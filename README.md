# Peter Griffin Nextbot
 A Peter Griffin Nextbot for Garry's Mod based off the Tiktok memes
 Ever since the Sanic Nextbot was released, creating nextbots has never been easier.
 
 Using debugged files from a nextbot labelled Puck-Man, I added my own sprite, sounds and
 chase times to this spawnable NPC. Don't view the sound files on your computer because
 they're very loud.
